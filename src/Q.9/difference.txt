Server Side Rendering (SSR):

SSR is a technique where the server renders the web content dynamically and sends a fully populated HTML response to the client.
In SSR, the server fetches the data, processes it, and generates the HTML with the data before sending it to the client.
With SSR, each request results in server-side processing and rendering, allowing dynamic content to be included in the initial response.
SSR is useful when you have frequently changing or personalized content, such as user-specific data or real-time data that needs to be fetched on each request.

Static Site Generation (SSG):

SSG is a technique where the web content is pre-rendered at build time and served as static HTML files.
In SSG, the site is generated during the build process, and the generated HTML files can be deployed to a static file server or a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
With SSG, the content is pre-rendered, so each request serves static HTML files without any server-side processing.
SSG is suitable when you have content that doesn't change frequently, such as blog posts, marketing pages, or documentation.
SSG offers improved performance and scalability as the static HTML files can be cached and served directly from a CDN, reducing the load on the server.

When to prefer SSG over SSR:

If your content doesn't require real-time data and doesn't change frequently, SSG can offer significant performance benefits as it eliminates the need for server-side processing on each request.
SSG can handle high traffic more efficiently since the static files can be served directly from a CDN without any server processing.

If you have a large-scale website with many pages, SSG can be more efficient as the content is pre-rendered during the build process, reducing the server load during runtime.
SSG is also beneficial when the infrastructure or server-side processing is limited or costly, as it simplifies the architecture by eliminating the need for server-side rendering on each request.
